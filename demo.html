        Open a text edtior which does not allow "rich text" (I also used

        Select as much text as you want in the browser. Make sure the selection

        On the mac, at least, press and hold on the selected text for a moment,
        and then drag
      </li>
      <li>
        Notice the drag feedback as you do this includes the text that is
        "user-select: none" even though it was not visibly selected.
      </li>
      <li>Drop the text in a rich text editor</li>
      <li>
        Notice that the dropped text includes the user-select: none text
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternately, copy and paste the text (cmd/ctrl+C) and paste it into that
        editor
      </li>
      <li>Notice that the user-select: none text is pasted</li>

      <li>Drag text again and drop the text in a plain text editor</li>
      <li>
        Notice that the dropped text does NOT include the user-select: none text
      </li>
